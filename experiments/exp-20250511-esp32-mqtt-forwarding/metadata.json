  "description": "This experiment validates that an ESP32 sensor node can successfully publish mock telemetry to a Raspberry Pi (node-beta) over MQTT. The ESP32 firmware connects to WiFi, publishes a JSON payload to the topic `esp32/telemetry`, and the broker forwards this to subscribed clients.",

    "mqtt_broker": "mosquitto on node-beta",
    "message_frequency": "1 msg/sec",
    "message_format": "JSON",
    "topic": "esp32/telemetry",
    "confirmation": "Verified via mosquitto_sub on odroid"
  },
  "notes": "This test confirms wireless MQTT telemetry from the ESP32 to a local MQTT broker. It lays the groundwork for secure telemetry forwarding and future blockchain-backed message logging."
