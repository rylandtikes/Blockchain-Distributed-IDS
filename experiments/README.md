# **Experiments Documentation**

## **Overview**
This directory contains logs, configurations, and results from various experiments related to the **Blockchain-Distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**. It includes tests on:

- **Federated Learning (Flower)** across Raspberry Pi and ESP32 devices
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Transformer-based models** (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT) for anomaly detection
- **Blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric)** for secure log storage and model integrity verification
- **IDS performance and attack detection** across signature-based and anomaly-based techniques
- **Host-based Intrusion Detection** using the HDFS Log Anomaly Dataset

Each experiment folder contains:
- Model checkpoints or training logs
- Evaluation results (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix)
- Relevant configuration files or scripts

## **Purpose**
The goal is to:
- Enable **reproducibility** of results
- Provide a record of **experiment configuration and outcomes**
- Facilitate **comparison across architectures, datasets, and model types**
